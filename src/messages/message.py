    A class to create and configure the message to be send.
    
    From the bot api under keyboard:
    One of the coolest things about our Bot API are the new 
    custom keyboards. Whenever your bot sends a message, it can pass 
    along a special keyboard with predefined reply options 
    (see ReplyKeyboardMarkup). Telegram apps that receive the message
    will display your keyboard to the user. Tapping any of the buttons
    will immediately send the respective command. This way you can 
    drastically simplify user interaction with your bot.

    We currently support text and emoji for your buttons. Here are some 
    custom keyboard examples:
        https://core.telegram.org/bots#keyboards
    The markup is build on the telegram bot api.
    See here for the main bot api:
