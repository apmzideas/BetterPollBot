### Description (/setdescription)
Work in progress! Please return later.
@BetterPollBot the place to create new polls (/newpoll), change old polls (/addanswer, /delanswer), reuse old polls (/polllink), and delete old polls (/delpoll) from your own poll database. Managing your polls does never take place in a group. Closing a running poll in a group (/endpoll) will automatically remove @BetterPollBot from the group to avoid spamming. Try /help for a list of all commands. Happy deciding!
